<h1><center>Feona Mae Lao Garcia</center></h1>

<p><center>Hi there, my full name is a mouth full but you can just call me Feona. I'm a San Diego native, but moved to Norcal in 2017 to finish my college degree here at SF State. I am majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Mathematics. It is my last semester here but in the past two years i've attained an immeasurable amount of knowledge. I know a plethora of languages such as Java, C, C++, HTML/CSS, SQL, and some Javascript. My favorite project thus far has got to be the multiplayer tank wars game that i made in Java, this was the first project i did not have skeleton code or anyone to work with. I prefer back end but i am hoping to learn more about front end in this class and with this project. In my spare time i do graphical design work for small organizations. As well aside from programming, i paint and read when i find the time too! I really look forward to this class and feel it will tecah me many valuable things that i can take with me to my career field after i graduate. </center></p>
